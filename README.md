# ESP32S3 LA66 LoRaWAN Module with LVGL TFT Interface

In this tutorial I am sharing with you guys my experiment with LA66 LoRaWan module from Dragino. 

I have interfaced the module using ESP32S3 MCU. While 2 LA66 modules were exchanging pingpong messages over 868MHz LoRa band, The MCU is receiving the RF communication report over UART and printing the log messages on a 1.9 8bit TFT display.

A simple user interface is designed using squareline software that uses LVGL library.

# ESP32S3 UI Design Using SquareLine Studio with LVGL For LA66 LoRaWAN Module
***
### [Tutorial Link](https://youtu.be/Omqit9cUYkk) On [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-FF0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube&logoColor=white)](https://www.youtube.com/wardzx1) 

In this tutorial, SquareLine Studio is used to design a user interface that uses the data received over UART from LA66 LoRaWAN module and displays it on 1.9 inch T Display S3  development board with ESP32S3. 

Using the designed interface, Wireless communication robustness test is conducted over two LA66 modules exchanging dummy data within an indoor environment. 

The way of integrating the designed interface with LVGL library to an existing projected and how to let the system interact and exchange data with it are explained in details.
